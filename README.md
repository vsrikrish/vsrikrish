# Hi, I'm Vivek Srikrishnan :wave:

I'm currently an Assistant Research Professor in the [Earth & Environmental Systems Institute](https://eesi.psu.edu) at [Penn State](https://www.psu.edu) and a Visiting Assistant Professor in the [Department of Biological & Environmental Engineering](https://bee.cals.cornell.edu) at [Cornell](https://www.cornell.edu). In July 2021, I'll join [Cornell BEE](https://bee.cals.cornell.edu) as an Assistant Professor. I study climate risk management, particularly decision-making under uncertainty and the impact of feedbacks between the coupled human, earth, and built systems. My interdisciplinary research combines systems engineering, climate dynamics, data science, decision science, and economics.

I received my Ph.D. and M.S.from the [Penn State Department of Energy and Mineral Engineering](https://eme.psu.edu). My undergraduate degrees are from the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://www.illinois.edu) in [Mathematics](https://math.illinois.edu) and [Philosophy](https://philosophy.illinois.edu/).
